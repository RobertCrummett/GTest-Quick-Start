## About GTest-Quick-Start
This is a brief example of how to download [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) using [Conan](https://conan.io/). The `CMakeLists.txt` file is a nice example of how to keep unit testing and application code separate.

**Note** \
I used some C++23 syntactic sugar in `factorial_test.cpp`, so make sure your Conan profile is current.
